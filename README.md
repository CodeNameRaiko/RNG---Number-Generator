# RNG---Number-Generator 
This RNG project i make use of

JS - DOM Manipulation 
Math.Random() function 
ClassList toggles 
(HERE IN BASEFILES ONLY)

this is the base file.
I have yet to implement: 

-Function that generates x amount of numbers given from the input 'amount of generated numbers'.

-Smoothen the styles a bit to make it look more appealing.

And i'll be making variants of these files adding and changing stuff and see whic versions looks best.
